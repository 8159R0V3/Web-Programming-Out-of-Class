# Web-Programming-Out-of-Class
My name is David Bisgrove. I am a senior computer science student at SUNY New Paltz. 
I have taken many computer classes such as cs 1-3, object oriented programming, game programming, embedded linux, and many more. 
I currently know java, c++, python, and im currently working on better understanding html-css.

I see this class being useful in my future since web programming is an invaluable skill for a computer science student to have and I look forward becoming more proficient in it.
I hope to use the skills I learn in this class to help me with future projects and to help me land potential jobs and/or internships in my future.
